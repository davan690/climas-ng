    This tool was developed by a team at
    <a href="http://eresearch.jcu.edu.au/">JCU's eResearch Centre</a>
    and uses species occurrence data from the
    <a href="http://www.ala.org.au/">Atlas of Living Australia</a> and
    climate data from <a href="http://climascope.tyndall.ac.uk">ClimaScope</a>
    and the <a href="http://www.eoc.csiro.au/awap/">Australian Water Availability Project</a>.

    The principal researcher and project advisor was Dr Jeremy VanDerWal.
