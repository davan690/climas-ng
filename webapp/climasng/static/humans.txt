SITE

Server side: Python/Pyramid app, wasn't much 
fun to write.

Client side: Hand-rolled javascript hooked 
onto a Backbone thing that Daniel is embarassed 
by.  Leaflet for map display, jQuery for 
fetching data and managing the DOM.


TOOLS

Daniel used Sublime Text 2 on OSX for editing,
and Vagrant for running Linux testing VMs.
LESSCSS and autoprefixer for CSS, CoffeeScript + 
Browserify for JavaScript, all hooked up with 
Gulp.  Mostly Diet Coke for caffeination.

Jeremy and Erin used maxent and R (and James Cook
Uni's HPC) for grinding the data.
