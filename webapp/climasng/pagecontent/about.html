<h2>About this tool</h2>
<p>
CliMAS provides interactive maps and regional reports to examine the future of species distributions and biodiversity across Australia.

</p><p>
It summarises mapped biodiversity of almost all Australian mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and freshwater fish and crayfish within suitable climate space projected by 18 different Global Climate Models (GCMs) and 2 potential emissions scenarios (RCPs) from 2015 to 2085.  Detailed lists of climate space losses and gains for each species are given.
</p>
<h3>Maps</h3>
<p>
The map section of CliMAS offers projected species distribution and biodiversity maps.  Each map type is offered at nine time points, two emission scenarios, and either the 10th, 50th or 90th percentile across the set of models used to project the future climate.  See the <a href="/science">Science page</a> for more information.
</p><p>
In additon, easy comparisons can be made by loading two maps and switching between them, demonstrated in the animation below which compares current and future distributions of the Northern Blossom Bat.

<h3>Reports</h3>
<p>
The report section of CliMAS offers a discussion of projected changes to climate and biodiversity for a specified region.  Reports are generated using the same data represented by the CliMAS maps.  Reports are customisable, to allow for a focus on a specific year or species taxon.
</p><p>
This enables visitors to investigate climate change in their region and to determine priority species. &nbsp; <a href="/reports">Create report now &raquo;</a>

<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>
Currently there is a general lack of engagement and knowledge transfer between professional researchers and the end-users of research (general public, conservation managers, decision-makers, etc.). This is reflected in a general lack of acceptance and acknowledgement by the public and stakeholders of the potential impacts of climate change, particularly on biodiversity.
</p><p>
Recently, researchers have begun to endeavour to make the results of their research public, however there is a scarcity of online tools that display species distribution data.  CliMAS provides a tool that exposes data available with Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) and the Tropical Data Hub in a visual and interactive way, to allow a broad range of end-users to explore the potential impacts of climate change on terrestrial vertebrate species in their region.
