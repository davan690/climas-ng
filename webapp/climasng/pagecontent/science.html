<h2>The science</h2>
<p>
    This project takes future climate projections and uses them to
    produce estimates of future species distributions.  This process
    involves several steps.
</p>
<h3>Generating species distributions</h3>
<p>
    Species occurrences were vetted for accuracy and
    plausibility.  These occurrences were compared
    statistically to current climate data at 0.01&deg;
    geographic resolution (often referred to as &ldquo;1
    km&rdquo; resolution) to produce a statistical model
    that predicts species survival given specified
    climate values.  This model is known as a Species
    Distribution Model or SDM and one was created for
    each species.
</p><p>
    Using the SDM and current climate conditions, a
    climate suitability map was created for each species.
    These suitability maps were then clipped by experts
    to remove areas with suitable climate that did not
    currently host the species.  This produced an estimate
    of the current species distribution.
</p>
<h3>Projecting future climate</h3>
<p>
    Future climate projections must account for a broad
    range of factors, such as population growth, land use,
    energy demand, and new technology.  The IPCC has defined
    a set of scenarios to represent potential futures.
</p><p>
    This project uses two of the four IPCC scenarios.
    RCP8.5, a scenario with continuing high emission
    of greenhouse gases, was selected to represent a
    "business as usual" future.  RCP4.5, a scenario in
    which greenhouse gas emission stabilises before 2100,
    was selected to represent a lower emission future.
</p><p>
    18 different global climate models or GCMs were used to
    generate climate projections for each selected RCP and
    each decadal time step from 2015 to 2085.
</p>
<h3>Projecting future species distributions</h3>
<p>
    The SDM for each species was then applied to future
    climate projections to create climate suitability
    maps.  These suitability maps were then clipped based
    on a realistic dispersal rate to remove areas that
    had newly suitable climate but could not be reached
    by the species.  A diagram demonstrating this process
    is shown below.

</p><p>
    Dispersal and suitability for freshwater fish and crayfish,
    and selected stream-dependent species of frogs and turtles,
    was calculated using stream flow data in addition to climate
    factors.
</p><p>
    The dispersal-clipped projections of different GCMs were
    summarised using the median or 50th percentile as a "best
    estimate", and the 10th and 90th percentiles to give an
    indication of variability between models.  This summarising
    across models produced the projected species distribution
    maps displayed in CliMAS' map interface.
</p>
<h3>Generating biodiversity values</h3>
<p>
    Maps for the species in each given taxa were reduced to
    a binary value of present or not-present.  Calculating the
    number of different species present at a given point (with
    10th, 50th and 90th percentile summaries across GCMs)
    produced the taxa biodiversity maps available in the map
    interface.
</p>
<h3>Regional summaries</h3>
<p>
    Projected species distributions were overlaid with region
    borders for each of the reportable regions.  This allowed
    the species potentially present in the region at a given
    projected future point to be listed.
</p><p>
    Similarly, region borders were used to clip temperature and
    rainfall values for current and future projections.  This
    provided numerical climate summary data with 10th 50th and
    90th percentiles, and this information is available along
    with species presence summaries from CliMAS' reports
    generation interface.
