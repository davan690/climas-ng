WEBSITE

Mostly a lightly updated version of the 
CliMAS website (climas.hpc.jcu.edu.au or
tropicaldatahub.org/goto/climas).

Server side: Python/Pyramid app. The search
index uses Whoosh (whoosh.readthedocs.io)
which is good.

Client side: Hand-rolled javascript hooked 
onto a Backbone thing that Daniel is embarassed 
by.  Leaflet for map display, jQuery for 
managing the DOM etc.


TOOLS

Daniel used Sublime Text 3 on macOS for editing,
LESSCSS and autoprefixer for CSS, CoffeeScript + 
Browserify for JavaScript, all hooked up with 
Gulp. Mostly Pepsi Max for caffeination.

Jeremy and Erin used maxent and R (and James Cook
Uni's HPC) for grinding the data.

Climate data came from CIAS (Community Integrated 
Assessment System) at Tyndall Climate Change 
Centre, which uses Climgen for its pattern 
scaling and downscaling.

Juliette's cafe provided caffeine to most 
of the team, although Jeff also enjoyed a few 
Pepsis Max.


The project is dedicated to the memory of
Professor Stephen H. Schneider
