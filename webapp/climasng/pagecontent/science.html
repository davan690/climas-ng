<h2>The science</h2>
<p>
    This project takes future climate projections and uses them to
    produce estimates of future species distributions.  This process
    involves several steps.
</p>
<h3>Generating species distributions</h3>
<p>
    Species occurrences were vetted, as much as possible 
    given the size of the dataset, for accuracy and
    plausibility.  These occurrences were compared
    statistically to current climate data at 
    10 arc minutes geographic resolution (often referred 
    to as &ldquo;20 km&rdquo; resolution) to produce a 
    statistical model that predicts species occurrence 
    probability given specified climate values.  This model 
    is known as a Species Distribution Model or SDM and one 
    was created for each species.
</p><p>
    Using the SDM and current climate conditions, a
    climate suitability map was created for each species.
    These suitability maps were then clipped using a
    set of parameters (see <span class="draft">zzz</span>)
    to produce an estimate of the current species distribution.
</p>
<h3>Projecting future climate</h3>
<p>
    Future climate projections must account for a broad
    range of factors, such as population growth, land use,
    energy demand, and new technology.  In the past the
    Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defined
    defined a set of scenarios to represent potential futures.
    However, starting with the fifth assessment report these
    were changed to represent potential future levels of
    radiative climate forcings through what are known as
    Representative Concentration Pathways or RCPs. This
    allows for differing changes in technology, population,
    etc to potentially lead to the same level of climate
    change.
</p><p>
    Rather than deal with multiple different possible 
    scenarios occurring over different times (the way 
    previous studies have looked at change) this project 
    looks at the potential impacts on biodiversity at 
    different amounts of warming above pre-industrial 
    levels – these are referred to as specific warming 
    levels. These were drawn from versions of the RCPs 
    produced for the UK Government as part of their 
    AVOID2 project, and more detail can be found at 
    <span class="draft">yyyy</span>. The advantage to 
    this approach is that it is more adaptation friendly 
    and provides outcomes that better tie in with stated 
    policy goals (e.g., to hold temperature to less than 
    2&deg;C). 21 different global climate models or GCMs 
    were used to generate climate projections for each 
    selected temperature step.
    <span class="draft">Should we mention time and dispersal?
    Relevant mostly for 1.5 and 2C wher the temperature
    is reached early but dispersal has not played entirely out...</span>
</p>
<h3>Projecting future species distributions</h3>
<p>
    The future climate projections were then run through
    the SDM for each species to create projected future 
    climate suitability maps.  The maps allow you to look
    at either the situation where a species is unable to 
    undertake any climate mediated dispersal (e.g. barriers
    or slow dispersal rates) or allowed to move 
    (<span class="draft">tick the allow species to move 
    button</span>) based on a realistic dispersal rate to
    remove areas that had newly suitable climate but could
    not be reached by the species.
    A diagram demonstrating this process is shown below.
    More on dispersal rates can be found in 
    <span class="draft">zzz</span>.

    The projections of different GCMs, with and without 
    movement, were summarised using the median or 50th 
    percentile as a "best estimate" or “central tendency”, 
    and then summarised again at 10th, 33rd, 66th, and 90th
    percentiles to give an indication of variability between 
    climate models to help assess uncertainty. This 
    summarising across models produced the projected species
    distribution maps displayed in the Wallace Initiative map
    interface.

</p>
<h3>Generating biodiversity values</h3>
<p>
    Maps for the species in each given taxa, family, and some 
    genera were reduced to
    a binary value of present or not-present.  Calculating the
    number of different species present at a given point (with
    10th, 33rd, 50th, 66th and 90th percentile summaries across
    GCMs) produced the biodiversity maps available in the map
    interface.
</p>
<h3>Regional summaries</h3>
<p>
    Projected species distributions were overlaid with 
    region borders from the Terrestrial Ecosystems of 
    the World (TEOW, see credits) for each of the 
    reportable regions. This allowed the species potentially 
    present in the region at a given projected future point 
    to be listed.  For Protected Areas, the boundaries of 
    the Protected Area (from the World Database of Protected 
    Areas, see credits) were mapped to the most appropriate 
    ecosystem.  While it is possible to request data for a 
    given protected area, the data is for the entire 
    ecosystem, owing to a better match with the spatial 
    resolution of the underlying species model data (e.g., 
    in many cases a small protected area would lie entirely 
    within a single data cell for climate and biodiversity).
</p><p>
    Similarly, region borders were used to clip temperature and
    rainfall values for current and future projections.  This
    provided numerical climate summary data with 10th 50th and
    90th percentiles, and this information is available along
    with species presence summaries from the Wallace Initiative's
    reports generation interface.
