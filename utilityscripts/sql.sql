/*

 * SQL used to query the Catalogue of Life data

 */

/* 

To use this:

- get a Catalogue Of Life dump, and import it into postgres into a 
database called `catol`.

- run this at the command line:
    psql -td catol < sql.sql > sqljson.json

- run:
    python sqljson2commonnamelist.py
which reads sqljson.json and produces commonnames.json


Query used to join the taxon table to the vernacular (common name) table, 
but restricting the number of common names retrieved to just the top 5 
(the ` vernacular."rowindex" <= 5 ` bit chooses how many).

Getting a "top 5" per taxonID, for multiple taxonIDs, is surprisingly hard
for SQL. The trick here is to:

- do an inner subquery that sorts all the vernacularName values according 
    to our preference.
- run another subquery on that result, using row_number() -- which is a 
    "window" function available in postgres but not MySQL -- to add a 
    rowIndex, but when partitioned by taxonID, which means each individual 
    taxonID's set of vernacularNames gets numbered, starting at 1 for the 
    taxon's most preferred vernacularName, then 2 etc.
- now finally you can take the result of that outer subquery, which includes
    all taxonIDs and vernacularNames but now the vernacularNames are numbered,
    match on taxonID to get your species, and filter out the less-preferred 
    names by selecting only small values of rowIndex. Phew!
- around that is a JSON process that aggregates the rows into a big ol' json
    object.
